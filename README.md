# SearchEngine

This repository implements a search engine that utilizes BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for semantic document retrieval.


# Download or clone the repository

To clone the repository, use the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/bsraigur/SearchEngine.git
```


# Key Features:

1) Semantic Retrieval: Leverages BERT to understand the meaning behind search queries and documents, retrieving results most relevant to the user's intent.
2) Two-Stage Retrieval:
    Retriever pre-filters documents based on keywords.
    Results are then re-ranked based on their semantic similarity to the query using BERT.
